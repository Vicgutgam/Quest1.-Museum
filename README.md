<h3>Introduction:</h3>

This project has its origins in the practices of a data analysis Bootcamp. It is inspired by the typical "create your own story" notebooks where the journey of the adventure is the adventure itself, with the outcome being unimportant.






<h3>What does the code currently do?</h3>
It is currently in a very primitive state and only includes a few functions related to the responses that the user can give.
The code is developed in a very linear way, following the initial inspiration, but it already has some dictionaries introduced that I hope can be completed over time.





<h3>Improvement plans:</h3>
"""Development of an inventory with greater relevance in history.

Inclusion of a clock that only allows playing during museum hours.

Give the possibility of returning to past rooms."""
